The saves folder should contain the saves of all the active games.
The folder should contain data needed to load and resume each world as it was left.
The save folder should also remember what mods were active during the game so they can mount the right mods
	also, so the launcher knows which saves to display (if the game was launched in vanilla, all saves with
	mods listed are not displayed).
